# ReducingIIinHLS
Pipelining loops is one of the main optimisation techniques in High-Level Synthesis (HLS). The main parameter in loop pipelining is the initiation interval (II), which determines the number of clock cycles between two iterations of a pipelined loop. 
In this video series, I take an example and explain how to modify the code to improve the initiation interval. If you have any particular accelerator code, you can leave that in the comments, and I will try to optimise your code and explain that in a video.
